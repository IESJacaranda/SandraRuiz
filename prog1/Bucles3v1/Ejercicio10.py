Ejercicio 10
Design a method called friend that receives two positive number as parameters. The method should return true if the 
number are friends and false in other case. Two numbers are friends if the addition of all the divisors less the 
same number of the one number is equal to the second number and in the other case too. If the parameters are not 
valid the method should return false.
